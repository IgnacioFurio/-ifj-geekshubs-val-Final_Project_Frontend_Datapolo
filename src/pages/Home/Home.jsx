                    Designed by a waterpolo coach, for waterpolo coaches. This tool will help you keep track of the information that you may need to check later.
                    Imagine a way of storing all the goals of the match, "But I can just check at the FINA page or similar", and you'd be right, but... Where 
                    is your friendly matches data? And what about your training games? or even better... Do you know what is your strongest area?. Datapolo tries
                    to solve all these problems.
